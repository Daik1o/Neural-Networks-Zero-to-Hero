Hi!
This is my first GitHub Repository, and I'll be using this to organize my progress in Andrey's YouTube course [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXYLzZ3XzIbi4lL43O6fIU_ojuZwBO6vi).

Btw, it's a really great introductory course for Neural Networks, so you should definitely take it if you want to learn the basics about neural nets and Deep Learning.
